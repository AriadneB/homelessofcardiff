  <h1>Dinner with the homeless</h1>
  <h2>Looking at one of Cardiff's biggest problems</h2>

  <h4>I sat down at the table, observing the people sat around me as they were handed plates and cutlery. </h4>
  <p>A huge pot of chilli con carne sat on the table accompanied by a crop of jacket potatoes with butter and cheese. "Another brew, love?" one of the helpers, Alayna, loudly offered me.</p>

  <p>This was the day that the homeless offered me to stay for dinner.</p>

<h3>Currently in 2016</h3>
<p>Homelessness, a problem which seems unavoidable, is a growing problem for much of the UK. </p>
<p>Over two weeks in November 2015, based off information gathered by local organisations and groups, it was estimated that there were 240 rough-sleepers in Wales, with the majority of them residing in Cardiff.</p>
<p>According to the Wallich, a homeless charity and hostel in Cardiff, the Welsh capital alone has seen a 64% increase in the number of people sleeping rough.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Perret-Atkins, 66, of Cardiff started up <a href="http://rainbowofhope.co.uk/">Rainbow of Hope</a> 22 years ago when she felt called by God to help the city's homeless. </p>
<p>Now a full-time charity, it was started by Elizabeth handing out pork pies and crisps to the hungry of Cardiff.</p>

<section class="start content">

<p> Rainbow of Hope, a Cardiff-based charity, offers advice, support and essentials to people in need around the city whether they're a rough-sleeping homeless person or not, a refugee or just struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<p> Two homeless men, Gareth and Robert, regularly attend the drop-in sessions on week-day afternoons. </p>
<p>Robert has been sleeping rough on the streets of Cardiff for 13 months, meanwhile Gareth, who has been homeless on and off since 2008, has previously slept rough but currently has somewhere to stay.</p>

<p> As I was handed my plate of chilli and potato, it surprised me how welcoming the people at the drop-in session were – afterall, I was a stranger eating their food.</p>
<p>They were fascinated, if not slightly weary, of my camera and the fact that somebody had taken an interest in them and their lives.</p>
<p> One of the more unique and communal aspects about Rainbow of Hope is the number of helpers who either do or have relied on it in the past.</p>
<p> The sense of community in the building was incredible as if somebody turned up late, there would be an automatic offer to share food or source more.</p>
<p>There was a huge amount of diversity in the people present at the drop-in session; young and old, people who used to have well-paid jobs and nice homes, elderly couples, young families and even refugees.</p>

  <h1>The Paradise Run:</h1>

<section class="start content">

<p>The Paradise Run, arguably what Rainbow of Hope are best known for, is a soup run which takes place every night (including Christmas day and bank holidays) which is often compiled of volunteers from a few of the local churches.</p>
  <p>It hands out hot and cold food and drinks, as well as food that people can take home with them once the run has ended for the following days.</p>

</div>
<p>It was clear from observing the Paradise Run that the world of the homeless is completely seperate, as people walked past either on their way to a night out or on their way home from shopping, barely noticing the people around them who were so eagerly waiting just to have an evening meal. </p>
<p>There are other hostels and charities which are open to helping the homeless of Cardiff, from the Wallich hostel to the Huggard Centre, however they all come with their own reputations.</p>
</section>

<section class="start content">
  <p>While Rainbow of Hope has a good reputation as a relatively safe environment, Gareth and Robert talked about how some of the other centres were in more dangerous areas. </p>
    <p>The Huggard Centre, a local hostel and charity, is allegedly popular with criminals and drug abusers which apparently puts off other homeless people from visiting.</p>

  <h2>Encountering the homeless
</h2>
<p>I asked eight random, anonymous, people from South Wales about their experience with the homeless in Cardiff. </p>
<p>Four of the people I asked think that one person is unable to make a difference – this is surprising considering that the four people who felt that one person could make a difference either were helping, had helped or wanted to help the homeless.</p>
<p>It is important not to white wash the homeless situation – you can approach any homeless person with the best intentions and still receive the worst response.</p>
<p>This is why it is arguably better to help as part of a group – there really is logic behind the saying 'safety in numbers'.</p>
<p>When asked, the eight people spoke about memorable experiences they'd had with the homeless, whether good or bad. </p>
<p>Five of the people talked about times where they had received a good reaction. However, two of the people spoke about the homeless coming across as being aggressive; one mentioned a woman walking directly up to them and 'demanding' change, and the other mentioned experiences of homeless people getting angry when refused change.</p>


<div style="float:right;margin-left:15px;">

</div>
<p>One of the people questioned said: "You can build up great and long term relationships and encourage people on their journey. I have seen great progress in homeless people and their lives." </p>
<p>It is evident that there is a lack of information regarding the homeless, what help is available and where the people who become homeless are failed – the charities and the people who have experienced homelessness claimed that the government and charities are doing as much as they can at the moment, but that it is the housing associations and benefits system which are hugely to blame.</p>


<p>However, people who have not experienced homelessness, whether they have helped out or not, either were not sure as to whether the government were doing enough, or thought they definitely were not. Aside from the charity leaders, practically nobody had an idea of what government help is available.</p>

    <h1>So, what other help is available?</h1>
  </header>
</section>

<section class="content">
  <p>In 2014, the Housing (Wales) Act came into place in the hope of reducing the homeless problem. According the Welsh Government website: "The main objective of the law is to ensure people who are homeless or facing homelessness receive help as early as possible</p>
  <div style="float:left;margin-right:15px;">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UuX4SrRBz_E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
<p>It places a duty on local authorities to work with people who are at risk of losing their home within 56 days to help find a solution to their problems. It is hoped the new provisions will prevent 3 out of 4 people at risk of homelessness from losing their home."</p>
<p> One charity which has recently made its first appearance in Wales is called <a href="http://hopeintoaction.org.uk/">Hope Into Action</a>. Hope Into Action, started in Petersborough, is a charity which enables churches to fund a house for people 'in need' to live in, whether they be convicts, ex-sex workes, refugees or homeless. Currently with 60 tenants in 38 houses across 12 cities, it gives people a home while they get their life back on track.</p>

<p>Caroline Johnson, one of the people helping to set up a house in Newport as a part of Hope Into Action, said: "As far as I know there is nothing like it in South Wales so hopefully all will go well. We set up a cold winter night shelter eight years ago but Newport needs recovery and housing and I believe the church is a good place to work with those on the streets who want to move from maintenance to recovery. We have a journey to get things set up. We will be converting 40ft containers to provide accommodation - one has already been completed for those we are working with."</p>

  </div>

<p>If anything can be concluded from my time eating and chatting with the homeless people in Cardiff, another attitude which has to change is that of the people who encounter the homeless every day and walk on by without a second thought.</p>
<p>Helping does not necessarily mean rumaging around in your wallet for that £1.50 you know is laying around somewhere that "will probably go on alcohol or drugs" – helping can be directing a homeless person to the nearest help centre, buying them a £3 meal deal from one of the supermarkets, or just donating a pack of biscuits and some fruit to your local soup run. If that's too much, you can even report where they are to <a href="http://www.streetlink.org.uk/">Street Link</a> who will help connect them to local services.</p>
<p>All too often we overlook homeless people, but we're forgetting that they are still people, and like anybody else, they deserve food and a roof over their head.</p>
